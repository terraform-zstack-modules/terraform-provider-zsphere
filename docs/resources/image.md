# zsphere_image (Resource)

This resource allows you to manage images in ZSphere. An image represents a virtual machine image format qcow2, raw, vmdk or an ISO file that can be used to create or boot virtual machines. You can define the image's properties, such as its URL, format, architecture, and backup storage locations.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "zsphere_image_storages" "test" {
  name = "BS-1-勿删"
}

resource "zsphere_image" "image" {
  name                = "test-from-terraform"
  description         = "Add An example image from terraform"
  url                 = "http://minio.zstack.io:9001/packer/logserver-by-packer-image-compressed.qcow2"
  guest_os_type       = "Linux"
  platform            = "Linux"
  format              = "qcow2"
  architecture        = "x86_64"
  virtio              = true
  image_storage_uuids = [data.zsphere_image_storages.test.image_storages.0.uuid]
  boot_mode           = "Legacy"
  expunge             = true

}

output "zsphere_image" {
  value = zsphere_image.image
}
```
