## Contributing to the provider

The ZStack Provider for Terraform is the work of many contributors. We appreciate your help!

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.20+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.



You may also [report an issue](https://github.com/ZStack-Robot/terraform-provider-zstack/issues/new). 

    Here is an example of how to clone this repository and switch to the directory:

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/ZStack-Robot/terraform-provider-zstack.git
    $ cd terraform-provider-zstack
    ```

## Acceptance Testing
Before making a release, the resources and data sources are tested automatically with acceptance tests (the tests are located in the zstack/*_test.go files).
You can run them by entering the following instructions in a terminal:
```
cd $GOPATH/src/xxxx/zstack/terraform-provider-zstack
export ZSPHERE_HOST=xxx
export ZSPHERE_ACCOUNT_NAME=xxx
export ZSPHERE_ACCOUNTP_ASSWORD=xxx
export ZSPHERE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=xxx
export ZSPHERE_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=xxx
export outfile=gotest.out


```
